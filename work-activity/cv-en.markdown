I specialize in cross-platform (Linux and Windows) C/C++ development.
My interests lie in the field of CAD/CAE/CAM
You can find out more about the results of my work [here]({% link work-activity/cax-experience-en.markdown %}).

&#9874; Work history:
* **[CIAM](https://ciam.ru), Senior programmer (04.2023 - 11.2024)**
  CAE development for the fluid flow simulation.
  I was involved in the selection of the application's architecture, the writing of the program code, the setup of the build environment, and the organization of automated build and testing processes.
  *Stack*: `C++17`, `OpenCASCADE`, `CMake`, `Qt`, `OpenGL`, `Docker`, `vcpkg`.
* **[VNIIEF](https://www.vniief.ru), Senior research fellow (10.2009 - 02.2023).** 
  My work involved scientific research and the development of innovative methods for creating three-dimensional computational grids used in numerical modeling of stress and fluid flow analysis.
  My responsibilities included the entire software development process for the modules I worked on.
  This included gathering requirements, communicating with users, researching available information, selecting the program architecture, writing the code, testing the software, maintaining and improving the program's features, documenting the work, and writing articles and presenting at conferences.
  The list of publications, including journal articles and conference presentations, is provided [here]({% link _posts/2022-03-27-publications.markdown %}).
  *Stack*: `C++14`, `STL`, `boost`, `CMake`, `c3d`, `3dtv`, `gtest`, `linux`, `bash`, `HPC`, `OpenMP`, `MPI`, `Qt`, `OpenGL`.
* **[Sarov National Research Nuclear University «MEPhI»](https://sarfti.ru), Senior lecturer, part-time job (from 09.2019)**.
  I teach classes on subjects "System and application software" и "Modern computer technologies".
  I deliver lectures, conduct practical exercises, and prepare educational materials.
  Some of them are ["Introduction to Git"](https://wolodyx.github.io/git-intro) и ["UNIX shell"](https://wolodyx.github.io/unixshell).
  *Stack*: `Jupyter Book`, `Markdonw`, `Git`, `GitHub`, `UNIX/Linux`.
* **"LLC Engineering Center", Engineer of relay protection and automation (06.2008 - 10.2009).**
  Design and manufacture of small digital devices for monitoring electrical voltage, frequency and current.
  I programmed 8-bit PIC and AVR microcontrollers in assembly language.
  I involved in the creation of the prototype, the small-scale manufacturing of the devices, the preparation of technical documentation for them.
  Together with the team, we introduced 5 types of devices into production.
  *Stack*: PIC and AVR microcontrollers, assembly language, Proteus Design Suite, digital electronic circuits, P-CAD.

&#127891; Education:
* I graduated from faculty of Informatics and Computer Engineering of [Chuvash State University](https://www.chuvsu.ru) by speciality of "Computer hardware and automated systems software", full-time form of study (2004 - 2009).
