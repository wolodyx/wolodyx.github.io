[Русская версия]({% link work-activity/cv-ru.markdown %})

I specialize in cross-platform (Linux and Windows) C/C++ development.
My interests lie in the field of CAD/CAE/CAM

Solving such problems requires knowledge of computational mathematics, geometry, algorithms and data structures.
It also requires skills in managing program complexity, optimizing performance and organizing automatic testing to prevent application regression.
I have all the knowledge and skills listed above to varying degrees.

You can find out more about the results of my work [here]({% link work-activity/cax-experience-en.markdown %}).

&#9874; Work history:
* **[CIAM](https://ciam.ru), Senior programmer (04.2023 - 11.2024)**
  CAE development for the fluid flow simulation.
  I was involved in the selection of the application's architecture, the writing of the program code, the setup of the build environment, and the organization of automated build and testing processes.
  *Stack*: `C++17`, `OpenCASCADE`, `CMake`, `Qt`, `OpenGL`, `Docker`, `vcpkg`.
* **[VNIIEF](https://www.vniief.ru), Senior research fellow (10.2009 - 02.2023).** 
  Scientific research and the development of innovative methods for creating three-dimensional computational grids used in numerical modeling of stress and fluid flow analysis.
  I participated in the development of a CAE application and the C++ libraries for 3D computational grid generation:
  - developing of multiblock mesh generation module (2010-2018);
  - developing of boundary layer extraction module (2018-2023);
  - integrating of components into the application and their maintenance;
  - publishing scientific articles and speaking at conferences.

  My responsibilities included the entire software development process for the modules I worked on.
  This included gathering requirements, communicating with users, researching available information, selecting the program architecture, writing the code, testing the software, integrating into the application, maintaining and improving the program's features, documenting the work, and writing articles and presenting at conferences.
  The list of publications, including journal articles and conference presentations, is provided [here]({% link _posts/2022-03-27-publications.markdown %}).
  *Stack*: `C++14`, `STL`, `boost`, `CMake`, `c3d`, `3dtv`, `gtest`, `linux`, `bash`, `HPC`, `OpenMP`, `MPI`, `Qt`, `OpenGL`.
* **[Sarov National Research Nuclear University «MEPhI»](https://sarfti.ru), Senior lecturer, part-time job (from 09.2019)**.
  I teach classes on subjects "System and application software" и "Modern computer technologies".
  I deliver lectures, conduct practical exercises, and prepare educational materials.
  Some of them are ["Introduction to Git"](https://wolodyx.github.io/git-intro) и ["UNIX shell"](https://wolodyx.github.io/unixshell).
  *Stack*: `Jupyter Book`, `Markdonw`, `Git`, `GitHub`, `UNIX/Linux`.
* **"LLC Engineering Center", Engineer of relay protection and automation (06.2008 - 10.2009).**
  Design and manufacture of small digital devices for monitoring electrical voltage, frequency and current.
  I programmed 8-bit PIC and AVR microcontrollers in assembly language.
  I involved in the creation of the prototype, the small-scale manufacturing of the devices, the preparation of technical documentation for them.
  Together with the team, we introduced 5 types of devices into production.
  *Stack*: PIC and AVR microcontrollers, assembly language, Proteus Design Suite, digital electronic circuits, P-CAD.

&#127891; Education:
* I graduated from faculty of Informatics and Computer Engineering of [Chuvash State University](https://www.chuvsu.ru) by speciality of "Computer hardware and automated systems software", full-time form of study (2004 - 2009).
