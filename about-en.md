&#128075; Hi, everyone!
My name is Valdimir Lazarev.
I live in Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.

I specialize in cross-platform (Linux and Windows) C/C++ development.
My interests lie in the field of CAD/CAE/CAM
You can find out more about the results of my work [here]({% link work-activity/cax-experience-en.markdown %}).

&#9874; Work history:
* **[CIAM](https://ciam.ru), Senior programmer (04.2023 - 11.2024)**
  CAE development for the fluid flow simulation.
  I was involved in the selection of the application's architecture, the writing of the program code, the setup of the build environment, and the organization of automated build and testing processes.
  *Stack*: `C++17`, `OpenCASCADE`, `CMake`, `Qt`, `OpenGL`, `Docker`, `vcpkg`.
* **[VNIIEF](https://www.vniief.ru), Senior research fellow (10.2009 - 02.2023).** 
  My work involved scientific research and the development of innovative methods for creating three-dimensional computational grids used in numerical modeling of stress and fluid flow analysis.
  My responsibilities included the entire software development process for the modules I worked on.
  This included gathering requirements, communicating with users, researching available information, selecting the program architecture, writing the code, testing the software, maintaining and improving the program's features, documenting the work, and writing articles and presenting at conferences.
  The list of publications, including journal articles and conference presentations, is provided [here]({% link _posts/2022-03-27-publications.markdown %}).
  *Stack*: `C++14`, `STL`, `boost`, `CMake`, `c3d`, `3dtv`, `gtest`, `linux`, `bash`, `HPC`, `OpenMP`, `MPI`, `Qt`, `OpenGL`.
* **[Sarov National Research Nuclear University «MEPhI»](https://sarfti.ru), Senior lecturer, part-time job (from 09.2019)**.
  I teach classes on subjects "System and application software" и "Modern computer technologies".
  I deliver lectures, conduct practical exercises, and prepare educational materials.
  Some of them are ["Introduction to Git"](https://wolodyx.github.io/git-intro) и ["UNIX shell"](https://wolodyx.github.io/unixshell).
  *Stack*: `Jupyter Book`, `Markdonw`, `Git`, `GitHub`, `UNIX/Linux`.
* **"LLC Engineering Center", Engineer of relay protection and automation (06.2008 - 10.2009).**
  Design and manufacture of small digital devices for monitoring electrical voltage, frequency and current.
  I programmed 8-bit PIC and AVR microcontrollers in assembly language.
  I involved in the creation of the prototype, the small-scale manufacturing of the devices, the preparation of technical documentation for them.
  Together with the team, we introduced 5 types of devices into production.
  *Stack*: PIC and AVR microcontrollers, assembly language, Proteus Design Suite, digital electronic circuits, P-CAD.

&#127891; Education:
* I graduated from faculty of Informatics and Computer Engineering of [Chuvash State University](https://www.chuvsu.ru) by speciality of "Computer hardware and automated systems software", full-time form of study (2004 - 2009).

&#128293; My projects:
* **[The single-board programmable microcomputer](https://github.com/wolodyx/EduBoard/blob/master/docs/diploma-presentation.pdf).**
  The microcomputer was developed as part of my thesis, under the guidance of A.G. Alekseev, a wonderful mentor.
  I am grateful for the opportunity he gave me to implement his vision of creating a programmable single-board educational computer.
  The device has been used for laboratory work in the course "Digital Electronics" over the past two years.
  During this time, we designed and manufactured five microcomputers based on the MCS 51 microcontroller, with external RAM and non-volatile memory, and various I/O expansion modules.
  The microcomputers connected to a work computer via serial port, loading programs into non-volatile memory.
  The user could select the programming/execution mode of the program using a switch on the board.
  *Stack*: `C++`, `WxWidgets`, digital electronic circuits, `P-CAD`, assembly language.
* **The control program for remote video cameras.**
  In 2009, I was approached with a request to help automate the uploading of images from remote CCTV cameras.
  The cameras that were purchased were equipped with a basic graphics program, which allowed for only simple user operations.
  The manufacturer was unwilling to expand the functionality of the program, but they did provide documentation on the protocol.
  I have created a program that interfaces with the camera using a GPS modem.
  The program connects to the camera periodically and uploads the image to a local folder.
  The graphical portion of the program is built on the wxWidgets framework, while the ffmpeg library is used to convert the video stream from H.264 to JPEG.
  This program is used to monitor the conditions of a section of the M7 Federal Highway.
  *Stack*: `C++`, `FFmpeg`, `WinAPI`, `wxWidgets`, modem control.
